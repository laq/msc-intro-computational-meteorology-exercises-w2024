# Europe Solar Energy

**Main Question**:
To satisfy Europe's energy, how much area needs to be covered by Solar Panels, and where? 

Step questions Main question:
* How much energy does covering Europe with panels would produce
* How much energy yearly does energy consume
* How much area would need to be covered
* Where should we put the solar panels?

Follow up questions:
* Can we make the count accounting for months of max usage and least radiation
* Can we account for energy accumulation?

## Phases

1. Upper bound: How much energy can we produce if we fill Europe with solar panels
    * 1.1. Use spatial mean of Europe square times area of Europe
    * 1.2. Use Europe square and get the area per box




### Phase 1
Get a rough upper bound of possible energy production when covering all Europe
with solar panels


For this purpose we need:

* An estimate of Europe energy needs
    Steps:
        1. A yearly sum
        2. A monthly sum
        3. A daily sum


* A way to decide what counts as Europe:
    Steps:
        1. Use a box for coordinates: lat(35,70) long(-10, 30)
        2. Use spacial mean of the box times the area of Europe
        3. Cut the border of coordinates


* Estimate how much energy a panel produces in a specific place
    Steps:
        1. Calculate pvpot
        2. Decide for a standard panel to use: 

## Energy Required:

## Energy produced:

### Energy produced per $m^2$

Our model solar panel has a specification
of  $237W/m^2$ 

If we multiply that by the pvpot we get the W/m^2 that can be generated in a 
specific spot.
